  About Me:
    I am a Senior Computer Science major at Michigan State University. I was born and raised
    in Lansing, MI. I have two brothers, one of which is my twin! I came to MSU originally
    as a Chemical Engineering, but I later found out that I wanted to something that will
    allow me to think and do things outside the box without too many strict rules to
    what I can do. I found Computer Science to be an interesting and fun topic to study
    about and with technology on the rise in society, I chose to take the CSE route.
