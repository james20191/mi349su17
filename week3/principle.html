    <p>
      On this website we will focus mainly on the hyperlinks of websites. Hyperlinks
      is an example of affordance since just like a handle affords pulling, a
      hyperlink affords faster access to another website. It is also served to
      cite sources and saves space on your word websites.

    <p>
      This page does a great job of representing Hick's Law. The reasoning behind
      that statment is that this website involves a simple decision-making process
      and it also involves looking through a menu and it also gives enough decsions
      for their readers to make.

      This site relates to mapping since it organizes everything a vistor to MSU's
      sites might need/want to know. In this site a user might want to learn more about
      MSU's academic information, so clicking the academic button will show
      more information a user might expect to see.

  </article>
  <p>
    On the left side of the page shows a great example of Modularity. It takes
    all of the materials for a class and divides them up into modules to make the
    design of the course easier for the student to manage. Thus, combining all
    of the modules will help the students be sucessful in MI 349.
